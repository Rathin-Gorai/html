            <h3>Automated Crop Disease Detection using IoT </h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
                Automated crop disease detection refers to the use of technology, such as machine learning, image processing, and data analysis, to automatically identify and detect diseases in crops. This approach aims to provide early and accurate detection of diseases, enabling timely intervention and targeted treatment to mitigate the impact on crop yield and quality. Here's an overview of the key components and steps involved in automated crop disease detection:


            <p>
              1. Data Collection: To detect crop diseases automatically, various data sources can be utilized, including images, spectral data (such as hyperspectral or multispectral imaging), and sensor data (such as temperature or humidity measurements). These data sources provide valuable information about the crops and the presence of diseases.
            </p>


            <p>
                2.Image Acquisition: High-resolution images of crops are captured using devices such as drones, satellites, or cameras installed in the field. These images can be taken in visible light or other spectral ranges to capture specific disease-related characteristics, such as color changes or leaf textures.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Data Readings: The soil moisture sensor continuously or periodically measures the moisture content in the soil and provides corresponding data readings. The readings can be in the form of electrical resistance, capacitance, tension, or other measurable units depending on the sensor technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Data Analysis and Interpretation: The data collected from the soil moisture sensor is analyzed and interpreted to determine the moisture level in the soil. This information is used to make informed decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water management, and plant health.
            </p>
            
          <p>
            It's important to note that automated crop disease detection systems are continuously improving as technology advances. Integration with real-time monitoring, remote sensing, and data analytics platforms can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection, enabling timely and targeted actions to mitigate the impact of diseases on crops.
